# Updating

## Backing up

First, just to be sure, after stopping your node, back up your channels via Ride The Lightning, Thunderhub or LNCLI. This is a good habit to get into on a regular basis anyway and not just when updates are made.

### RTL
        
If you have [RTL](/lightning-extensions/ride-the-lightning) running you can easily backup.

* Go to your RTL dashboard at, say, `192.168.1.6:3000`.
* Choose "Backups" under "Lightning."
* Click on "Backup All"

Now in `/home/ubuntu/RTL/backup/node-1/` there is a file called `channel-all.bak`.

## Stop services

Stop the services that depend on LND like Ride The Lightning or Thunderhub and LND itself.

```bash
sudo systemctl stop lnd
```

## Retrieve and compile source code

Enter the LND directory.

```bash
cd ~/lnd
```

Update the repository with the latest changes via Git.

```bash
git fetch --all
```

Show the latest version/tag/release.

```bash
git describe --tags `git rev-list --tags --max-count=1`
```

Retrieve the changes from the latest release.

```bash
git checkout -f <OUTPUT FROM PREVIOUS STEP> #example: v0.16.2-beta
```

Now install the software.

```bash
make install tags="autopilotrpc signrpc walletrpc chainrpc invoicesrpc routerrpc watchtowerrpc monitoring"
```

## Start the services

Start the service `lnd` and monitor the progress of the startup. Be patient this may take a while.

```bash
sudo systemctl start lnd

sudo journalctl -f -u lnd
```

Once you see in the output past that you can unlock the wallet, start a second terminal window.

```bash
lncli unlock
```

Now enter your passphrase from your wallet. Now in the other window you will see the GossipSyncer which means that LND is back on the air.

Check the current version of LND.

```bash
lncli --version
```

The output will look like `lncli version 0.16.2-beta commit=v0.16.2-beta`.

LND is now updated! Now start the other services that depend on LND such as RTL or Thunderhub.
